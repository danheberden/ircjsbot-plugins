The only required parameter is a map of CSS properties. This map is similar to the one that can be sent to the <code>.css()<\/code> method, except that the range of properties is more restrictive.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"animation-properties\">Animation Properties and Values<\/h4>\n<p>All animated properties should be animated to a <em>single numeric value<\/em>, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, <code>width<\/code>, <code>height<\/code>, or <code>left<\/code> can be animated but <code>background-color<\/code> cannot be, unless the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/jquery\/jquery-color\">jQuery.Color()<\/a> plugin is used). Property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified. The units <code>em<\/code> and <code>%<\/code> can be specified where applicable.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to style properties, some non-style properties such as <code>scrollTop<\/code> and <code>scrollLeft<\/code>, as well as custom properties, can be animated.<\/p>\n<p>Shorthand CSS properties (e.g. font, background, border) are not fully supported. For example, if you want to animate the rendered border width, at least a border style and border width other than \"auto\" must be set in advance. Or, if you want to animate font size, you would use <code>fontSize<\/code> or the CSS equivalent <code>'font-size'<\/code> rather than simply <code>'font'<\/code>. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings <code>'show'<\/code>, <code>'hide'<\/code>, and <code>'toggle'<\/code>. These shortcuts allow for custom hiding and showing animations that take into account the display type of the element.<\/p>\n<p>Animated properties can also be relative. If a value is supplied with a leading <code>+=<\/code> or <code>-=<\/code> sequence of characters, then the target value is computed by adding or subtracting the given number from the current value of the property.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Unlike shorthand animation methods such as <code>.slideDown()<\/code> and <code>.fadeIn()<\/code>, the <code>.animate()<\/code> method does <em>not<\/em> make hidden elements visible as part of the effect. For example, given <code>$('someElement').hide().animate({height:'20px'}, 500)<\/code>, the animation will run, but <em>the element will remain hidden<\/em>.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"duration\">Duration<\/h4>\n<p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The default duration is <code>400<\/code> milliseconds. The strings <code>'fast'<\/code> and <code>'slow'<\/code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200<\/code> and <code>600<\/code> milliseconds, respectively.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"complete\">Complete Function<\/h4>\n<p>If supplied, the <code>complete<\/code> callback function is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this<\/code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"basic-usage\">Basic Usage<\/h4>\n<p>To animate any element, such as a simple image:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;div id=\"clickme\"&gt;\n  Click here\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;img id=\"book\" src=\"book.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"123\"\n  style=\"position: relative; left: 10px;\" \/&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>To animate the opacity, left offset, and height of the image simultaneously:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#clickme').click(function() {\n  $('#book').animate({\n    opacity: 0.25,\n    left: '+=50',\n    height: 'toggle'\n  }, 5000, function() {\n    \/\/ Animation complete.\n  });\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p class=\"image\">\n  <img src=\"\/images\/animate-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/>\n<\/p>\n<p>Note that the target value of the <code>height<\/code> property is <code>'toggle'<\/code>. Since the image was visible before, the animation shrinks the height to 0 to hide it. A second click then reverses this transition:\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"image\">\n<img src=\"\/images\/animate-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/>\n<\/p>\n\n<p>The <code>opacity<\/code> of the image is already at its target value, so this property is not animated by the second click. Since the target value for <code>left<\/code> is a relative value, the image moves even farther to the right during this second animation.<\/p>\n<p>Directional properties (<code>top<\/code>, <code>right<\/code>, <code>bottom<\/code>, <code>left<\/code>) have no discernible effect on elements if their  <code>position<\/code> style property is <code>static<\/code>, which it is by default.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note: <\/strong>The <a href=\"http:\/\/jqueryui.com\">jQuery UI<\/a> project extends the <code>.animate()<\/code> method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated. The project also includes mechanisms for specifying animations through CSS classes rather than individual attributes.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> if attempting to animate an element with a height or width of 0px, where contents of the element are visible due to overflow, jQuery may clip this overflow during animation. By fixing the dimensions of the original element being hidden however, it is possible to ensure that the animation runs smoothly. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=clearfix\">clearfix<\/a> can be used to automatically fix the dimensions of your main element without the need to set this manually.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<h4 id=\"step\">Step Function<\/h4>\n<p>The second version of <code>.animate()<\/code> provides a <code>step<\/code> option \u2014 a callback function that is fired at each step of the animation. This function is useful for enabling custom animation types or altering the animation as it is occurring. It accepts two arguments (<code>now<\/code> and <code>fx<\/code>), and <code>this<\/code> is set to the DOM element being animated.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code>now<\/code>: the numeric value of the property being animated at each step<\/li>\n  <li><code>fx<\/code>: a reference to the <code>jQuery.fx<\/code> prototype object, which contains a number of properties such as <code>elem<\/code> for the animated element, <code>start<\/code> and <code>end<\/code> for the first and last value of the animated property, respectively, and <code>prop<\/code> for the property being animated.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note that the <code>step<\/code> function is called for each animated property on each animated element. For example, given two list items, the <code>step<\/code> function fires four times at each step of the animation:  <\/p>\n<pre>$('li').animate({\n  opacity: .5,\n  height: '50%'\n},\n{\n  step: function(now, fx) {\n    var data = fx.elem.id + ' ' + fx.prop + ': ' + now;\n    $('body').append('&lt;div&gt;' + data + '&lt;\/div&gt;');\n  }\n});<\/pre>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"easing\">Easing<\/h4>\n<p>The remaining parameter of <code>.animate()<\/code> is a string naming an easing function to use. An easing function specifies the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing<\/code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear<\/code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href=\"http:\/\/jqueryui.com\/\">jQuery UI suite<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"per-property-easing\">Per-property Easing<\/h4>\n<p>As of jQuery version 1.4, you can set per-property easing functions within a single <code>.animate()<\/code> call. In the first version of <code>.animate()<\/code>, each property can take an array as its value: The first member of the array is the CSS property and the second member is an easing function.  If a per-property easing function is not defined for a particular property, it uses the value of the <code>.animate()<\/code> method's optional easing argument. If the easing argument is not defined, the default <code>swing<\/code> function is used.<\/p>\n<p>For example, to simultaneously animate the width and height with the <code>swing<\/code> easing function and the opacity with the <code>linear<\/code> easing function:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#clickme').click(function() {\n  $('#book').animate({\n    width: ['toggle', 'swing'],\n    height: ['toggle', 'swing'],\n    opacity: 'toggle'\n  }, 5000, 'linear', function() {\n      $(this).after('&lt;div&gt;Animation complete.&lt;\/div&gt;');\n  });\n});<\/pre>\n<p>In the second version of <code>.animate()<\/code>, the options map can include the <code>specialEasing<\/code> property, which is itself a map of CSS properties and their corresponding easing functions.  For example, to simultaneously animate the width using the <code>linear<\/code> easing function and the height using the <code>easeOutBounce<\/code> easing function:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#clickme').click(function() {\n  $('#book').animate({\n    width: 'toggle',\n    height: 'toggle'\n  }, {\n    duration: 5000,\n    specialEasing: {\n      width: 'linear',\n      height: 'easeOutBounce'\n    },\n    complete: function() {\n      $(this).after('&lt;div&gt;Animation complete.&lt;\/div&gt;');\n    }\n  });\n});<\/pre>\n<p>As previously noted, a plugin is required for the <code>easeOutBounce<\/code> function.<\/p>\n\n","categories":["Effects > Custom","Version > Version 1.0"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/animated-selector\/","name":"animated","title":":animated Selector","type":"selector","signatures":[{"added":"1.2"}],"desc":"Select all elements that are in the progress of an animation at the time the selector is run.","longdesc":"<longdesc\/>","categories":["Selectors > Basic Filter","Selectors > jQuery Extensions","Version > Version 1.2"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/append\/","name":"append","title":".append()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.0","params":[{"name":"content","type":"String, Element, jQuery","optional":"","desc":"DOM element, HTML string, or jQuery object to insert at the end of each element in the set of matched elements."},{"name":"content","type":"String, Element, Array, jQuery","optional":"optional","desc":"One or more additional DOM elements, arrays of elements, HTML strings, or jQuery objects to insert at the end of each element in the set of matched elements."}]},{"added":"1.4","params":[{"name":"function(index, html)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function that returns an HTML string, DOM element(s), or jQuery object to insert at the end of each element in the set of matched elements.

For earlier versions, the <code>.bind()<\/code> method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements <em>must exist<\/em> at the point the call to <code>.bind()<\/code> occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the discussion of event delegation in <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/on\"><code>.on()<\/code><\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/delegate\"><code>.delegate()<\/code><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Any string is legal for <code>eventType<\/code>; if the string is not the name of a native DOM event, then the handler is bound to a custom event. These events are never called by the browser, but may be triggered manually from other JavaScript code using <code>.trigger()<\/code> or <code>.triggerHandler()<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>If the <code>eventType<\/code> string contains a period (<code>.<\/code>) character, then the event is namespaced. The period character separates the event from its namespace. For example, in the call <code>.bind('click.name', handler)<\/code>, the string <code>click<\/code> is the event type, and the string <code>name<\/code> is the namespace. Namespacing allows us to unbind or trigger some events of a type without affecting others. See the discussion of <code>.unbind()<\/code> for more information.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are shorthand methods for some standard browser events such as <a href=\"\/click\"><code>.click()<\/code><\/a> that can be used to attach or trigger event handlers. For a complete list of shorthand methods, see the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/events\/\">events category<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>When an event reaches an element, all handlers bound to that event type for the element are fired. If there are multiple handlers registered, they will always execute in the order in which they were bound. After all handlers have executed, the event continues along the normal event propagation path.<\/p>\n\n<p>A basic usage of <code>.bind()<\/code> is:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$('#foo').bind('click', function() {\n  alert('User clicked on \"foo.\"');\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>This code will cause the element with an ID of <code>foo<\/code> to respond to the <code>click<\/code> event. When a user clicks inside this element thereafter, the alert will be shown.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"multiple-events\">Multiple Events<\/h4>\n<p>Multiple event types can be bound at once by including each one separated by a space:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$('#foo').bind('mouseenter mouseleave', function() {\n  $(this).toggleClass('entered');\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>The effect of this on <code>&lt;div id=\"foo\"&gt;<\/code> (when it does not initially have the \"entered\" class) is to add the \"entered\" class when the mouse enters the <code>&lt;div&gt;<\/code> and remove the class when the mouse leaves. <\/p>\n<p>As of jQuery 1.4 we can bind multiple event handlers simultaneously by passing a map of event type\/handler pairs:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$('#foo').bind({\n  click: function() {\n    \/\/ do something on click\n  },\n  mouseenter: function() {\n    \/\/ do something on mouseenter\n  }\n});\n<\/pre>\n<h4 id=\"event-handlers\">Event Handlers<\/h4>\n<p>The <code>handler<\/code> parameter takes a callback function, as shown above. Within the handler, the keyword <code>this<\/code> refers to the DOM element to which the handler is bound. To make use of the element in jQuery, it can be passed to the normal <code>$()<\/code> function. For example:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').bind('click', function() {\n  alert($(this).text());\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>After this code is executed, when the user clicks inside the element with an ID of <code>foo<\/code>, its text contents will be shown as an alert.\n<\/p>\n<p>As of jQuery 1.4.2 duplicate event handlers can be bound to an element instead of being discarded. This is useful when the event data feature is being used, or when other unique data resides in a closure around the event handler function.<\/p>\n\n<p>In jQuery 1.4.3 you can now pass in <code>false<\/code> in place of an event handler. This will bind an event handler equivalent to: <code>function(){ return false; }<\/code>. This function can be removed at a later time by calling: <code>.unbind( eventName, false )<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"event-object\"><a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/events\/event-object\/\">The Event object<\/a><\/h4>\n\n<p>The <code>handler<\/code> callback function can also take parameters. When the function is called, the event object will be passed to the first parameter.<\/p>\n<p>The event object is often unnecessary and the parameter omitted, as sufficient context is usually available when the handler is bound to know exactly what needs to be done when the handler is triggered. However, at times it becomes necessary to gather more information about the user's environment at the time the event was initiated. <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/events\/event-object\/\">View the full Event Object<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Returning <code>false<\/code> from a handler is equivalent to calling both <code>.preventDefault()<\/code> and <code>.stopPropagation()<\/code> on the event object.<\/p>\n<p>Using the event object in a handler looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre>$(document).ready(function() {\n  $('#foo').bind('click', function(event) {\n    alert('The mouse cursor is at ('\n      + event.pageX + ', ' + event.pageY + ')');\n  });\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>Note the parameter added to the anonymous function. This code will cause a click on the element with ID <code>foo<\/code> to report the page coordinates of the mouse cursor at the time of the click.<\/p>\n\n<h4 id=\"passing-event-data\">Passing Event Data<\/h4>\n<p>The optional <code>eventData<\/code> parameter is not commonly used. When provided, this argument allows us to pass additional information to the handler. One handy use of this parameter is to work around issues caused by closures. For example, suppose we have two event handlers that both refer to the same external variable:<\/p>\n<pre>var message = 'Spoon!';\n$('#foo').bind('click', function() {\n  alert(message);\n});\nmessage = 'Not in the face!';\n$('#bar').bind('click', function() {\n  alert(message);\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>Because the handlers are closures that both have <code>message<\/code> in their environment, both will display the message <span class=\"output\">Not in the face!<\/span> when triggered. The variable's value has changed. To sidestep this, we can pass the message in using <code>eventData<\/code>:\n<\/p>\n<pre>var message = 'Spoon!';\n$('#foo').bind('click', {msg: message}, function(event) {\n  alert(event.data.msg);\n});\nmessage = 'Not in the face!';\n$('#bar').bind('click', {msg: message}, function(event) {\n  alert(event.data.msg);\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>This time the variable is not referred to directly within the handlers; instead, the variable is passed in <em>by value<\/em> through <code>eventData<\/code>, which fixes the value at the time the event is bound. The first handler will now display <span class=\"output\">Spoon!<\/span> while the second will alert <span class=\"output\">Not in the face!<\/span>\n<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note that objects are passed to functions <em>by reference<\/em>, which further complicates this scenario.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If <code>eventData<\/code> is present, it is the second argument to the <code>.bind()<\/code> method; if no additional data needs to be sent to the handler, then the callback is passed as the second and final argument.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>See the <code>.trigger()<\/code> method reference for a way to pass data to a handler at the time the event happens rather than when the handler is bound.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n<p>As of jQuery 1.4 we can no longer attach data (and thus, events) to object, embed, or applet elements because critical errors occur when attaching data to Java applets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note: <\/strong>Although demonstrated in the next example, it is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the <code>click<\/code> and <code>dblclick<\/code> events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click events before the <code>dblclick<\/code> and others only one. Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser, and is often user-configurable.<\/p>\n","categories":["Events > Event Handler Attachment","Version > Version 1.0","Version > Version 1.4","Version > Version 1.4.3"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/blur\/","name":"blur","title":".blur()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.0","params":[{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute each time the event is triggered."}]},{"added":"1.4.3","params":[{"name":"eventData","type":"Object","optional":"optional","desc":"A map of data that will be passed to the event handler."},{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute each time the event is triggered."}]},{"added":"1.0"}],"desc":"Bind an event handler to the \"blur\" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.","longdesc":"\n<p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.bind('blur', handler)<\/code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger('blur')<\/code> in the third.<\/p>\n<p>The <code>blur<\/code> event is sent to an element when it loses focus.

If not, the string is interpreted as a selector expression, as explained above. But if the string appears to be an HTML snippet, jQuery attempts to create new DOM elements as described by the HTML.

When the parameter has a single tag, such as  <code>$('&lt;img\u00a0\/&gt;')<\/code> or  <code>$('&lt;a&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;')<\/code>, jQuery creates the element using the native JavaScript <code>createElement()<\/code> function.<\/p>\n\n<p>When passing in complex HTML, some browsers may not generate a DOM that exactly replicates the HTML source provided.

For example, Internet Explorer prior to version 8 will also convert all <code>href<\/code> properties on links to absolute URLs, and Internet Explorer prior to version 9 will not correctly handle HTML5 elements without the addition of a separate <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/html5shiv\/\">compatibility layer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n      <p>To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed. Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing tag:<\/p>\n      <pre>$('&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\"&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;');<\/pre>\n      <p>Alternatively, jQuery allows XML-like tag syntax (with or without a space before the slash):<\/p>\n      <pre>$('&lt;a\/&gt;');<\/pre>\n      <p>Tags that cannot contain elements may be quick-closed or not:<\/p>\n      <pre>$('&lt;img \/&gt;');\n$('&lt;input&gt;');\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>When passing HTML to <code>jQuery()<\/code>, please also note that text nodes are not treated as DOM elements. With the exception of a few methods (such as <code>.content()<\/code>), they are generally otherwise ignored or removed. E.g:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\nvar el = $('1&lt;br\/&gt;2&lt;br\/&gt;3'); \/\/ returns [&lt;br&gt;, \"2\", &lt;br&gt;] \nel  = $('1&lt;br\/&gt;2&lt;br\/&gt;3 &gt;'); \/\/ returns [&lt;br&gt;, \"2\", &lt;br&gt;, \"3 &amp;gt;\"]\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>This behaviour is expected. <\/p>\n\n<p>As of jQuery 1.4, the second argument to <code>jQuery()<\/code> can accept a map consisting of a superset of the properties that can be passed to the <a href=\"\/attr\">.attr()<\/a> method. Furthermore, any <a href=\"\/category\/events\/\">event type<\/a> can be passed in, and the following jQuery methods can be called: <a href=\"\/val\">val<\/a>, <a href=\"\/css\">css<\/a>, <a href=\"\/html\">html<\/a>, <a href=\"\/text\">text<\/a>, <a href=\"\/data\">data<\/a>, <a href=\"\/width\">width<\/a>, <a href=\"\/height\">height<\/a>, or <a href=\"\/offset\">offset<\/a>.

They receive the returned data, a string containing the success code, and the <code>jqXHR<\/code> object.<\/li>\n        <li><code>complete<\/code> callbacks fire, in the order they are registered, when the request finishes, whether in failure or success. They receive the <code>jqXHR<\/code> object, as well as a string containing the success or error code.<\/li>\n      <\/ol>\n      <p>For example, to make use of the returned HTML, we can implement a <code>success<\/code> handler:<\/p>\n<pre>$.ajax({\n  url: 'ajax\/test.html',\n  success: function(data) {\n    $('.result').html(data);\n    alert('Load was performed.');\n  }\n});<\/pre>\n\n      <h4 id=\"data-types\">Data Types<\/h4>\n      <p>The <code>$.ajax()<\/code> function relies on the server to provide information about the retrieved data. If the server reports the return data as XML, the result can be traversed using normal XML methods or jQuery's selectors. If another type is detected, such as HTML in the example above, the data is treated as text.<\/p>\n      <p>Different data handling can be achieved by using the <code>dataType<\/code> option. Besides plain <code>xml<\/code>, the <code>dataType<\/code> can be <code>html<\/code>, <code>json<\/code>, <code>jsonp<\/code>, <code>script<\/code>, or <code>text<\/code>.<\/p>\n      <p>The <code>text<\/code> and <code>xml<\/code> types return the data with no processing. The data is simply passed on to the success handler, either through the <code>responseText<\/code> or <code>responseXML<\/code> property of the <code>jqXHR<\/code> object, respectively.<\/p>\n      <p><strong>Note:<\/strong> We must ensure that the MIME type reported by the web server matches our choice of <code>dataType<\/code>. In particular, XML must be declared by the server as <code>text\/xml<\/code> or <code>application\/xml<\/code> for consistent results.<\/p>\n      <p>If <code>html<\/code> is specified, any embedded JavaScript inside the retrieved data is executed before the HTML is returned as a string. Similarly, <code>script<\/code> will execute the JavaScript that is pulled back from the server, then return nothing.<\/p>\n      <p>The <code>json<\/code> type parses the fetched data file as a JavaScript object and returns the constructed object as the result data. To do so, it uses <code>jQuery.parseJSON()<\/code> when the browser supports it; otherwise it uses a <code>Function<\/code> <strong>constructor<\/strong>. Malformed JSON data will throw a parse error (see <a href=\"http:\/\/json.org\/\">json.org<\/a> for more information). JSON data is convenient for communicating structured data in a way that is concise and easy for JavaScript to parse. If the fetched data file exists on a remote server, specify the <code>jsonp<\/code> type instead.<\/p>\n      <p>The <code>jsonp<\/code> type appends a query string parameter of <code>callback=?<\/code> to the URL. The server should prepend the JSON data with the callback name to form a valid JSONP response. We can specify a parameter name other than <code>callback<\/code> with the <code>jsonp<\/code> option to <code>$.ajax()<\/code>.<\/p>\n      <p><strong>Note:<\/strong> JSONP is an extension of the JSON format, requiring some server-side code to detect and handle the query string parameter. More information about it can be found in the <a href=\"http:\/\/bob.pythonmac.org\/archives\/2005\/12\/05\/remote-json-jsonp\/\">original post detailing its use<\/a>.<\/p>\n      <p>When data is retrieved from remote servers (which is only possible using the <code>script<\/code> or <code>jsonp<\/code> data types), the <code>error<\/code> callbacks and global events will never be fired.<\/p>\n\n          <h4 id=\"sending-data-to-server\">Sending Data to the Server<\/h4>\n          <p>By default, Ajax requests are sent using the GET HTTP method. If the POST method is required, the method can be specified by setting a value for the <code>type<\/code> option. This option affects how the contents of the <code>data<\/code> option are sent to the server. POST data will always be transmitted to the server using UTF-8 charset, per the W3C XMLHTTPRequest standard.<\/p>\n          <p>The <code>data<\/code> option can contain either a query string of the form <code>key1=value1&amp;key2=value2<\/code>, or a map of the form <code>{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}<\/code>. If the latter form is used, the data is converted into a query string using <code><a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/jQuery.param\/\">jQuery.param()<\/a><\/code> before it is sent. This processing can be circumvented by setting <code>processData<\/code> to <code>false<\/code>.  The processing might be undesirable if you wish to send an XML object to the server; in this case, change the <code>contentType<\/code> option from <code>application\/x-www-form-urlencoded<\/code> to a more appropriate MIME type.<\/p>\n\n          <h4 id=\"advanced-options\">Advanced Options<\/h4>\n          <p>The <code>global<\/code> option prevents handlers registered using <code><a href=\"\/ajaxSend\">.ajaxSend()<\/a><\/code>, <code><a href=\"\/ajaxError\">.ajaxError()<\/a><\/code>, and similar methods from firing when this request would trigger them. This can be useful to, for example, suppress a loading indicator that was implemented with <code><a href=\"\/ajaxSend\">.ajaxSend()<\/a><\/code> if the requests are frequent and brief. With cross-domain script and JSONP requests, the global option is automatically set to <code>false<\/code>. See the descriptions of these methods below for more details.  See the descriptions of these methods below for more details.<\/p>\n          <p>If the server performs HTTP authentication before providing a response, the user name and password pair can be sent via the <code>username<\/code> and <code>password<\/code> options.<\/p>\n          <p>Ajax requests are time-limited, so errors can be caught and handled to provide a better user experience. Request timeouts are usually either left at their default or set as a global default using <code><a href=\"\/jQuery.ajaxSetup\">$.ajaxSetup()<\/a><\/code> rather than being overridden for specific requests with the <code>timeout<\/code> option.<\/p>\n          <p>By default, requests are always issued, but the browser may serve results out of its cache. To disallow use of the cached results, set <code>cache<\/code> to <code>false<\/code>. To cause the request to report failure if the asset has not been modified since the last request, set <code>ifModified<\/code> to <code>true<\/code>.<\/p>\n          <p>The <code>scriptCharset<\/code> allows the character set to be explicitly specified for requests that use a <code>&lt;script&gt;<\/code> tag (that is, a type of <code>script<\/code> or <code>jsonp<\/code>). This is useful if the script and host page have differing character sets.<\/p>\n          <p>The first letter in Ajax stands for \"asynchronous,\" meaning that the operation occurs in parallel and the order of completion is not guaranteed. The <code>async<\/code> option to <code>$.ajax()<\/code> defaults to <code>true<\/code>, indicating that code execution can continue after the request is made. Setting this option to <code>false<\/code> (and thus making the call no longer asynchronous) is strongly discouraged, as it can cause the browser to become unresponsive.<\/p>\n\n          <p>The <code>$.ajax()<\/code> function returns the <code>XMLHttpRequest<\/code> object that it creates. Normally jQuery handles the creation of this object internally, but a custom function for manufacturing one can be specified using the <code>xhr<\/code> option. The returned object can generally be discarded, but does provide a lower-level interface for observing and manipulating the request. In particular, calling <code>.abort()<\/code> on the object will halt the request before it completes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At present<\/strong>, due to a bug in Firefox where <code>.getAllResponseHeaders()<\/code> returns the empty string although <code>.getResponseHeader('Content-Type')<\/code> returns a non-empty string, automatically decoding JSON CORS responses in Firefox with jQuery is not supported.<\/p>\n\n<p>A workaround to this is possible by overriding <code>jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr<\/code> as follows:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\nvar _super = jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr;\njQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr = function () {\n    var xhr = _super(),\n        getAllResponseHeaders = xhr.getAllResponseHeaders;\n\n    xhr.getAllResponseHeaders = function () {\n        if ( getAllResponseHeaders() ) {\n            return getAllResponseHeaders();\n        }\n        var allHeaders = \"\";\n        $( [\"Cache-Control\", \"Content-Language\", \"Content-Type\",\n                \"Expires\", \"Last-Modified\", \"Pragma\"] ).each(function (i, header_name) {\n\n            if ( xhr.getResponseHeader( header_name ) ) {\n                allHeaders += header_name + \": \" + xhr.getResponseHeader( header_name ) + \"\\n\";\n            }\n            return allHeaders;\n        });\n    };\n    return xhr;\n};\n<\/pre>\n\n <h4>Extending Ajax<\/h4>\n     <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5<\/strong>, jQuery's Ajax implementation includes prefilters, converters, and transports that allow you to extend Ajax with a great deal of flexibility.

Given the following code, for example, a call to <code>$.ajax()<\/code> would automatically abort a request to the same URL if the custom <code>abortOnRetry<\/code> option is set to <code>true<\/code>:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\nvar currentRequests = {};\n\n$.ajaxPrefilter(function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {\n  if ( options.abortOnRetry ) {\n    if ( currentRequests[ options.url ] ) {\n      currentRequests[ options.url ].abort();\n    }\n    currentRequests[ options.url ] = jqXHR;\n  }\n});\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>Prefilters can also be used to modify existing options.

Using <code>$.Callbacks<\/code> as a topics queue, a system for publishing and subscribing to topics can be implemented as follows:<\/p>\n\n<pre>var topics = {};\n\njQuery.Topic = function( id ) {\n    var callbacks,\n        method,\n        topic = id &amp;&amp; topics[ id ];\n    if ( !topic ) {\n        callbacks = jQuery.Callbacks();\n        topic = {\n            publish: callbacks.fire,\n            subscribe: callbacks.add,\n            unsubscribe: callbacks.remove\n        };\n        if ( id ) {\n            topics[ id ] = topic;\n        }\n    }\n    return topic;\n};\n<\/pre>\n\n\n<p>This can then be used by parts of your application to publish and subscribe to events of interest quite easily:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\/\/ Subscribers\n$.Topic( \"mailArrived\" ).subscribe( fn1 );\n$.Topic( \"mailArrived\" ).subscribe( fn2 );\n$.Topic( \"mailSent\" ).subscribe( fn1 );\n\n\/\/ Publisher\n$.Topic( \"mailArrived\" ).publish( \"hello world!\" );\n$.Topic( \"mailSent\" ).publish( \"woo! mail!\" );\n\n\/\/ Here, \"hello world!\" gets pushed to fn1 and fn2\n\/\/ when the \"mailArrived\" notification is published\n\/\/ with \"woo! mail!\" also being pushed to fn1 when\n\/\/ the \"mailSent\" notification is published. \n\n\/*\noutput:\nhello world!\nfn2 says: hello world!\nwoo! mail!\n*\/\n<\/pre>\n\n\n<p>Whilst this is useful, the implementation can be taken further. Using <code>$.Deferreds<\/code>,  it's possible to ensure publishers only publish notifications for subscribers once particular tasks have been completed (resolved). See the below code sample for some further comments on how this could be used in practice:<\/p>\n\n<pre>\/\/ subscribe to the mailArrived notification\n$.Topic( \"mailArrived\" ).subscribe( fn1 );\n\n\/\/ create a new instance of Deferreds\nvar dfd = $.Deferred();\n\n\/\/ define a new topic (without directly publishing)\nvar topic = $.Topic( \"mailArrived\" );\n\n\/\/ when the deferred has been resolved, publish a \n\/\/ notification to subscribers\ndfd.done( topic.publish );\n\n\/\/ Here the Deferred is being resolved with a message\n\/\/ that will be passed back to subscribers. It's possible to\n\/\/ easily integrate this into a more complex routine\n\/\/ (eg. waiting on an ajax call to complete) so that\n\/\/ messages are only published once the task has actually\n\/\/ finished.\ndfd.resolve( \"its been published!\" );\n<\/pre>\n\n","categories":["Callbacks Object","Version > Version 1.7"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/jQuery.contains\/","name":"jQuery.contains","title":"jQuery.contains()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.4","params":[{"name":"container","type":"Element","optional":"","desc":"The DOM element that may contain the other element."},{"name":"contained","type":"Element","optional":"","desc":"The DOM element that may be contained by the other element."}]}],"desc":"Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element.","longdesc":"\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> The first argument <em>must<\/em> be a DOM element, not a jQuery object or plain JavaScript object.<\/p><\/blockquote>","categories":["Utilities","Version > Version 1.4"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/jQuery.cssHooks\/","name":"jQuery.cssHooks","title":"jQuery.cssHooks","type":"property","signatures":[{"added":"1.4.3"}],"desc":"Hook directly into jQuery to override how particular CSS properties are retrieved or set, normalize CSS property naming, or create custom properties.","longdesc":"<p>The <code>$.cssHooks<\/code> object provides a way to define functions for getting and setting particular CSS values.

Namespaces are similar to CSS classes in that they are not hierarchical; only one name needs to match. Namespaces beginning with an underscore are reserved for jQuery's use.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the second form of <code>.on()<\/code>, the <code>events-map<\/code> argument is a JavaScript Object, or \"map\". The keys are strings in the same form as the <code>events<\/code> argument with space-separated event type names and optional namespaces. The value for each key is a function (or <code>false<\/code> value) that is used as the <code>handler<\/code> instead of the final argument to the method. In other respects, the two forms are identical in their behavior as described below.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"direct-and-delegated-events\">Direct and delegated events<\/h2>\n\n<p>The majority of browser events <em>bubble<\/em>, or <em>propagate<\/em>, from the deepest, innermost element (the <strong>event target<\/strong>) in the document where they occur all the way up to the body and the <code>document<\/code> element. In Internet Explorer 8 and lower, a few events such as <code>change<\/code> and <code>submit<\/code> do not natively bubble but jQuery patches these to bubble and create consistent cross-browser behavior.<\/p>\n\n<p>If <code>selector<\/code> is omitted or is null, the event handler is referred to as <em>direct<\/em> or <em>directly-bound<\/em>. The handler is called every time an event occurs on the selected elements, whether it occurs directly on the element or bubbles from a descendant (inner) element.<\/p>\n\n<p>When a <code>selector<\/code> is provided, the event handler is referred to as <em>delegated<\/em>. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to <code>.on()<\/code>.<\/strong> To ensure the elements are present and can be selected, perform event binding inside a document ready handler for elements that are in the HTML markup on the page. If new HTML is being injected into the page, select the elements and attach event handlers <em>after<\/em> the new HTML is placed into the page. Or, use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next.<\/p>\n\n<p>Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from <em>descendant elements<\/em> that are added to the document at a later time. By picking an element that is guaranteed to be present at the time the delegated event handler is attached, you can use delegated events to avoid the need to frequently attach and remove event handlers. This element could be the container element of a view in a Model-View-Controller design, for example, or <code>document<\/code> if the event handler wants to monitor all bubbling events in the document. The <code>document<\/code> element is available in the <code>head<\/code> of the document before loading any other HTML, so it is safe to attach events there without waiting for the document to be ready.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored. On a data table with 1,000 rows in its <code>tbody<\/code>, this example attaches a handler to 1,000 elements:<\/p>\n<pre>\n$(\"#dataTable tbody tr\").on(\"click\", function(event){\n\talert($(this).text());\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>A delegated-events approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked <code>tr<\/code> to <code>tbody<\/code>):<\/p>\n<pre>\n$(\"#dataTable tbody\").on(\"click\", \"tr\", function(event){\n\talert($(this).text());\n});\n<\/pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"event-handler\">The event handler and its environment<\/h2>\n\n<p>The <code>handler<\/code> argument is a function (or the value <code>false<\/code>, see below), and is required unless the <code>events-map<\/code> form is used. You can provide an anonymous handler function at the point of the <code>.on()<\/code> call, as the examples have done above, or declare a named function and pass its name:<\/p>\n<pre>\nfunction notify() { alert(\"clicked\"); }\n$(\"button\").on(\"click\", notify);\n<\/pre>\n\n<p>When the browser triggers an event or other JavaScript calls jQuery's <code>.trigger()<\/code> method, jQuery passes the handler an <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/event-object\/\"><code>event object<\/code><\/a> it can use to analyze and change the status of the event. This object includes a <em>normalized subset<\/em> of data provided by the browser; the browser's unmodified native event object is available in <code>event.originalEvent<\/code>. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/event.type\"><code>event.type<\/code><\/a> contains the event name (e.g., \"resize\") and <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/event.target\"><code>event.target<\/code><\/a> indicates the deepest (innermost) element where the event occurred.<\/p>\n\n<p>By default, most events bubble up from the original event target to the <code>document<\/code> element. At each element along the way, jQuery calls any matching event handlers that have been attached. A handler can prevent the event from bubbling further up the document tree (and thus prevent handlers on those elements from running) by calling <code>event.stopPropagation()<\/code>. Any other handlers attached on the current element <em>will<\/em> run however. To prevent that, call <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation()<\/code>. (Event handlers bound to an element are called in the same order that they were bound.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a handler can call <code>event.preventDefault()<\/code> to cancel any default action that the browser may have for this event; for example, the default action on a <code>click<\/code> event is to follow the link. Not all browser events have default actions, and not all default actions can be canceled. See the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/DOM-Level-3-Events\/#event-types-list\">W3C Events Specification<\/a> for details.<\/p>\n\n<p>Returning <code>false<\/code> from an event handler will automatically call <code>event.stopPropagation()<\/code> and <code>event.preventDefault()<\/code>. A <code>false<\/code> value can also be passed for the <code>handler<\/code> as a shorthand for <code>function(){ return false; }<\/code>. So, <code>$(\"a.disabled\").on(\"click\", false);<\/code> attaches an event handler to all links with class \"disabled\" that prevents them from being followed when they are clicked and also stops the event from bubbling. <\/p>\n\n<p>When jQuery calls a handler, the <code>this<\/code> keyword is a reference to the element where the event is being delivered; for directly bound events this is the element where the event was attached and for delegated events this is an element matching <code>selector<\/code>. (Note that <code>this<\/code> may not be equal to <code>event.target<\/code> if the event has bubbled from a descendant element.) To create a jQuery object from the element so that it can be used with jQuery methods, use <code>$(this)<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passing-data\">Passing data to the handler<\/h2>\n\n<p>If a <code>data<\/code> argument is provided to <code>.on()<\/code> and is not <code>null<\/code> or <code>undefined<\/code>, it is passed to the handler in the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/event.data\/\"><code>event.data<\/code><\/a> property each time an event is triggered. The <code>data<\/code> argument can be any type, but if a string is used the <code>selector<\/code> must either be provided or explicitly passed as <code>null<\/code> so that the data is not mistaken for a selector. Best practice is to use an object (map) so that multiple values can be passed as properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>As of jQuery 1.4, the same event handler can be bound to an element multiple times. This is especially useful when the <code>event.data<\/code> feature is being used, or when other unique data resides in a closure around the event handler function. For example:<\/p>\n<pre>\nfunction greet(event) { alert(\"Hello \"+event.data.name); }\n$(\"button\").on(\"click\", { name: \"Karl\" }, greet);\n$(\"button\").on(\"click\", { name: \"Addy\" }, greet);\n<\/pre>\n<p>The above code will generate two different alerts when the button is clicked.<\/p>\n\n<p>As an alternative or in addition to the <code>data<\/code> argument provided to the <code>.on()<\/code> method, you can also pass data to an event handler using a second argument to <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/trigger\/\">.trigger()<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/triggerHandler\/\">.triggerHandler()<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"event-performance\">Event performance<\/h2>\n\n<p>In most cases, an event such as <code>click<\/code> occurs infrequently and performance is not a significant concern. However, high frequency events such as <code>mousemove<\/code> or <code>scroll<\/code> can fire dozens of times per second, and in those cases it becomes more important to use events judiciously. Performance can be increased by reducing the amount of work done in the handler itself, caching information needed by the handler rather than recalculating it, or by rate-limiting the number of actual page updates using <code>setTimeout<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<p>Attaching many delegated event handlers near the top of the document tree can degrade performance. Each time the event occurs, jQuery must compare all selectors of all attached events of that type to every element in the path from the event target up to the top of the document. For best performance, attach delegated events at a document location as close as possible to the target elements. Avoid excessive use of <code>document<\/code> or <code>document.body<\/code> for delegated events on large documents.<\/p>\n\n<p>jQuery can process simple selectors of the form <code>tag#id.class<\/code> very quickly when they are used to filter delegated events. So, <code>\"#myForm\"<\/code>, <code>\"a.external\"<\/code>, and <code>\"button\"<\/code> are all fast selectors. Delegated events that use more complex selectors, particularly hierarchical ones, can be several times slower--although they are still fast enough for most applications. Hierarchical selectors can often be avoided simply by attaching the handler to a more appropriate point in the document. For example, instead of <code>$(\"body\").on(\"click\", \"#commentForm .addNew\", addComment)<\/code> use <code>$(\"#commentForm\").on(\"click\", \".addNew\", addComment)<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional notes<\/h2>\n\n<p>There are shorthand methods for some events such as <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/click\/\"><code>.click()<\/code><\/a> that can be used to attach or trigger event handlers. For a complete list of shorthand methods, see the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/category\/events\/\">events category<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Deprecated as of jQuery 1.8:<\/em> The name <code>\"hover\"<\/code> used as a shorthand for the string <code>\"mouseenter mouseleave\"<\/code>. It attaches a <em>single event handler<\/em> for those two events, and the handler must examine <code>event.type<\/code> to determine whether the event is <code>mouseenter<\/code> or <code>mouseleave<\/code>. Do not confuse the \"hover\" pseudo-event-name with the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/hover\/\"><code>.hover()<\/code><\/a> method, which accepts <em>one or two<\/em> functions.<\/p>\n\n<p>jQuery's event system requires that a DOM element allow attaching data via a property on the element, so that events can be tracked and delivered. The <code>object<\/code>, <code>embed<\/code>, and <code>applet<\/code> elements cannot attach data, and therefore cannot have jQuery events bound to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <code>focus<\/code> and <code>blur<\/code> events are specified by the W3C to not bubble, but jQuery defines cross-browser <code>focusin<\/code> and <code>focusout<\/code> events that do bubble. When <code>focus<\/code> and <code>blur<\/code> are used to attach delegated event handlers, jQuery maps the names and delivers them as <code>focusin<\/code> and <code>focusout<\/code> respectively. For consistency and clarity, use the bubbling event type names.<\/p>\n\n<p>jQuery also specifically prevents right and middle clicks from bubbling as they don't occur on the element being clicked. Should working with the middle click be required, the <code>mousedown<\/code> or <code>mouseup<\/code> events should be used with <code>.on()<\/code> instead.<\/p>\n\n<p>In all browsers, the <code>load<\/code>, <code>scroll<\/code>, and <code>error<\/code> events (e.g., on an <code>&lt;img&gt;<\/code> element) do not bubble. In Internet Explorer 8 and lower, the <code>paste<\/code> and <code>reset<\/code> events do not bubble. Such events are not supported for use with delegation, but they <em>can<\/em> be used when the event handler is directly attached to the element generating the event.<\/p>\n\n<p>The <code>error<\/code> event on the <code>window<\/code> object uses nonstandard arguments and return value conventions, so it is not supported by jQuery. Instead, assign a handler function directly to the <code>window.onerror<\/code> property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n","categories":["Events > Event Handler Attachment","Version > Version 1.7"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/one\/","name":"one","title":".one()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.1","params":[{"name":"events","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A string containing one or more JavaScript event types, such as \"click\" or \"submit,\" or custom event names."},{"name":"data","type":"Object","optional":"optional","desc":"A map of data that will be passed to the event handler."},{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute at the time the event is triggered."}]},{"added":"1.7","params":[{"name":"events","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as \"click\" or \"keydown.myPlugin\"."},{"name":"selector","type":"String","optional":"optional","desc":"A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event.

Prior to jQuery 1.6, these properties were retrievable with the <code>.attr()<\/code> method, but this was not within the scope of <code>attr<\/code>. These do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>Concerning boolean attributes, consider a DOM element defined by the HTML markup <code>&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"checked\" \/&gt;<\/code>, and assume it is in a JavaScript variable named <code>elem<\/code>:<\/p>\n<table class=\"listing\">\n <tr>\n  <th><code>elem.checked<\/code><\/th>\n  <td><code>true<\/code> (Boolean) Will change with checkbox state<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n <tr>\n  <th><code>$(elem).prop(\"checked\")<\/code><\/th>\n  <td><code>true<\/code> (Boolean) Will change with checkbox state<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n <tr>\n  <th><code>elem.getAttribute(\"checked\")<\/code><\/th>\n  <td><code>\"checked\"<\/code> (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n <tr>\n  <th><code>$(elem).attr(\"checked\")<\/code><em>(1.6)<\/em><\/th>\n  <td><code>\"checked\"<\/code> (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n <tr>\n  <th><code>$(elem).attr(\"checked\")<\/code><em>(1.6.1+)<\/em><\/th>\n  <td><code>\"checked\"<\/code> (String) Will change with checkbox state<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n <tr>\n  <th><code>$(elem).attr(\"checked\")<\/code><em>(pre-1.6)<\/em><\/th>\n  <td><code>true<\/code> (Boolean) Changed with checkbox state<\/td>\n <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p>\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/interact\/forms.html#h-17.4\">W3C forms specification<\/a>, the <code>checked<\/code> attribute is a <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/intro\/sgmltut.html#h-3.3.4.2\">boolean attribute<\/a><\/em>, which means the corresponding property is true if the attribute is present at all\u2014even if, for example, the attribute has no value or an empty string value.

To maintain backwards compatability, the <code>.attr()<\/code> method in jQuery 1.6.1+ will retrieve and update the property for you so no code for boolean attributes is required to be changed to <code>.prop()<\/code>.

In the simplest case, with no arguments, <code>.unbind()<\/code> removes all handlers attached to the elements:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').unbind();<\/pre>\n<p>This version removes the handlers regardless of type. To be more precise, we can pass an event type:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').unbind('click');<\/pre>\n<p>By specifying the <code>click<\/code> event type, only handlers for that event type will be unbound. This approach can still have negative ramifications if other scripts might be attaching behaviors to the same element, however. Robust and extensible applications typically demand the two-argument version for this reason:<\/p>\n<pre>var handler = function() {\n  alert('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.');\n};\n$('#foo').bind('click', handler);\n$('#foo').unbind('click', handler);\n<\/pre>\n<p>By naming the handler, we can be assured that no other functions are accidentally removed.

To unbind a particular handler, we need a reference to that function and not a different one that happens to do the same thing.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Using a proxied function to unbind an event on an element will unbind all proxied functions on that element, as the same proxy function is used for all proxied events. To allow unbinding a specific event, use unique class names on the event (e.g. <code>click.proxy1<\/code>, <code>click.proxy2<\/code>) when attaching them.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h4>Using Namespaces<\/h4>\n<p>Instead of maintaining references to handlers in order to unbind them, we can namespace the events and use this capability to narrow the scope of our unbinding actions. As shown in the discussion for the <code>.bind()<\/code> method, namespaces are defined by using a period (<code>.<\/code>) character when binding a handler:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').bind('click.myEvents', handler);<\/pre>\n<p>When a handler is bound in this fashion, we can still unbind it the normal way:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').unbind('click');<\/pre>\n<p>However, if we want to avoid affecting other handlers, we can be more specific:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').unbind('click.myEvents');<\/pre>\n<p>We can also unbind all of the handlers in a namespace, regardless of event type:<\/p>\n<pre>$('#foo').unbind('.myEvents');<\/pre>\n<p>It is particularly useful to attach namespaces to event bindings when we are developing plug-ins or otherwise writing code that may interact with other event-handling code in the future.<\/p>\n<h4>Using the Event Object<\/h4>\n<p>The third form of the <code>.unbind()<\/code> method is used when we wish to unbind a handler from within itself. For example, suppose we wish to trigger an event handler only three times:<\/p>\n<pre>var timesClicked = 0;\n$('#foo').bind('click', function(event) {\n  alert('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.');\n  timesClicked++;\n  if (timesClicked &gt;= 3) {\n    $(this).unbind(event);\n  }\n});\n<\/pre>\n<p>The handler in this case must take a parameter, so that we can capture the event object and use it to unbind the handler after the third click. The event object contains the context necessary for <code>.unbind()<\/code> to know which handler to remove.\nThis example is also an illustration of a closure. Since the handler refers to the <code>timesClicked<\/code> variable, which is defined outside the function, incrementing the variable has an effect even between invocations of the handler.<\/p>\n","categories":["Events > Event Handler Attachment","Version > Version 1.0","Version > Version 1.4.3"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/undelegate\/","name":"undelegate","title":".undelegate()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.4.2"},{"added":"1.4.2","params":[{"name":"selector","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A selector which will be used to filter the event results."},{"name":"eventType","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A string containing a JavaScript event type, such as \"click\" or \"keydown\""}]},{"added":"1.4.2","params":[{"name":"selector","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A selector which will be used to filter the event results."},{"name":"eventType","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A string containing a JavaScript event type, such as \"click\" or \"keydown\""},{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute at the time the event is triggered."}]},{"added":"1.4.3","params":[{"name":"selector","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A selector which will be used to filter the event results."},{"name":"events","type":"Map","optional":"","desc":"A map of one or more event types and previously bound functions to unbind from them."}]},{"added":"1.6","params":[{"name":"namespace","type":"String","optional":"","desc":"A string containing a namespace to unbind all events from."}]}],"desc":"Remove a handler from the event for all elements which match the current selector, based upon a specific set of root elements.","longdesc":"\n  <p>The <code>.undelegate()<\/code> method is a way of removing event handlers that have been bound using <a href=\"\/delegate\"><code>.delegate()<\/code><\/a>. <strong>As of jQuery 1.7<\/strong>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/on\"><code>.on()<\/code><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/off\"><code>.off()<\/code><\/a> methods are preferred for attaching and removing event handlers.<\/p>\n","categories":["Events > Event Handler Attachment","Version > Version 1.4.2","Version > Version 1.4.3","Version > Version 1.6"],"download":""},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jquery.com\/unload\/","name":"unload","title":".unload()","type":"method","signatures":[{"added":"1.0","params":[{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute when the event is triggered."}]},{"added":"1.4.3","params":[{"name":"eventData","type":"Object","optional":"optional","desc":"A map of data that will be passed to the event handler."},{"name":"handler(eventObject)","type":"Function","optional":"","desc":"A function to execute each time the event is triggered."}]}],"desc":"Bind an event handler to the \"unload\" JavaScript event.","longdesc":"\n<p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.bind('unload', handler)<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>The <code>unload<\/code> event is sent to the <code>window<\/code> element when the user navigates away from the page.
